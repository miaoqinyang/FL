## Federated Learning Architecture Platform
This project focuses on providing experiments and resources for researchers in federated learning. Federated learning is a decentralized approach to machine learning where models are trained on distributed data sources without the need to centralize the data. It allows researchers to explore the challenges and potential solutions in privacy-preserving collaborative learning scenarios.
